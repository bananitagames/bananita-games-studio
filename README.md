# bananita-games-studio
Android Studio Project to support 2D game development

## It's free!
Feel free to use this project as an skeleton code base for your games.

You can also build the module **studio** and generate an **AAR file**, which is already included in the project.
It will be easier to use it along other projects you may have and apply updates.
